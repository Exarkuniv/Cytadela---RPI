Cytadela is a conversion of an old Amiga first person shooter. The original was created in mid 1990's by Virtual Design, and released firstly in Poland and then in other countries. 

As a conversion, this project tries to be as similar to the original as possible (but, what I think is quite obvious, this could not be achieved in 100%) and therefore there won't be any significant changes, only some gameplay improvements are possible. 

No data files are needed all are included
